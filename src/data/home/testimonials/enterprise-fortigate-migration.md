Defguard may be a young product, but it already outperforms most commercial VPN solutions we evaluated. We migrated 300–400 employees from FortiGate and saw immediate gains in speed, security, and user experience, all at a lower cost. What stood out was the modern, open foundation built on WireGuard and Rust, plus seamless SSO enrollment through Google Workspace. Early onboarding UX had a few rough edges, but the team moved fast on our feedback, releasing updates that made adoption smooth. Today, it's a mature zero-trust compliant platform backed by a responsive team.
