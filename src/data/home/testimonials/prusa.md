It's a unique modern VPN solution, not another extension based on WireGuard® with just web interface and MFA for login to the web without connection cover. You can run all microservices components written in Rust yourself without any requirements for communication with other services running by someone else and you have more options on how to run it, e.g. control plane on Kubernetes and gateways on other VMs. But it's not only VPN solution, it provides you also IDP like e.g. Keycloak so you can decrease the number of tools for hardening. And all of this is open-source with a community driven development.
