We'd been using Wireguard with OPNsense for years, but were always on the lookout for a way to use 2FA for our VPN login. Defguard turned out to be the perfect solution for us. After using it for three months now, logging into our VPN is more transparent and secure. Defguard integrates into OPNsense without a hitch. User onboarding is sorted in just a few minutes. The support team always got back to us quickly and sorted out our problems with real expertise. On top of that, the company is based in the EU – which is a big deal for us as a company that's serious about data protection.
