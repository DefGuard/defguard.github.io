        Looking for transparent and verifiable security solutions and not promises? As an
        open-source platform, Defguard offers full transparency, enabling organizations to
        verify security protocols and the actual code, ensuring trust through visible,
        verifiable security practices and not promises.

        We&apos;ve implemented defguard in Rust for code portability, security, and speed.
        You can easily run defguard on various Linux-based systems on x86, arm, and other
        architectures (including Raspberry PI, OpenWRT, etc.) and Unix systems FreeBSD,
        OpenBSD, and others. We&apos;ve prepared various Linux and OPNsenseÂ® (FreeBSD)
