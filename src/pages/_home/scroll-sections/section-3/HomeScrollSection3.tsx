        Looking for transparent and verifiable security solutions and not promises? As an

        verify security protocols and the actual code, ensuring trust through visible,

        We&apos;ve implemented defguard in Rust for code portability, security, and speed.
        You can easily run defguard on various Linux-based systems on x86, arm, and other
        architectures (including Raspberry PI, OpenWRT, etc.) and Unix systems FreeBSD,
        OpenBSD, and others. We&apos;ve prepared various Linux and OPNsenseÂ® (FreeBSD)
        but we are constantly working on other platforms.
