        <p>
          Defguard is built by a team passionate about privacy, security, and open
          technologies — created to meet a growing need for a modern, all-in-one solution
          to manage access to internal systems without relying on cloud services or third
          parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that security should be private by design, simple to deploy, and
          transparent in operation.

        <h3>That’s why Defguard is:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fully self-hosted – No external dependencies. Your data stays with you.</li>
          <li>
            Built for teams – Manage users, groups, and devices with role-based access
            control.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zero-trust ready – Define exactly who can access what, from where, with
            fine-grained ACLs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated – Works seamlessly with WireGuard®, LDAP/Active Directory, and
            your existing tools.

          Defguard is the result of over 15 years of deep-tech software development —
          built by a team with a proven track record in delivering secure,
          high-performance systems for some of the most demanding environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Security and reliability have always been at the core of what we do. Our
          background includes projects like secure infrastructure platforms, enterprise
          multi-factor authentication (such as for home.pl), and mission-critical backend
          systems — all built to perform under pressure.

    <FlexibleSection title="Our Vision" id="our-vision" variant="white" theme="light">
      <div slot="left">
        <p>
          Become the go-to privacy and security platform that enables any organization to
          implement fundamental security and privacy measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as GitLab became an on-premises and open-source alternative to GitHub, we
          aim for Defguard to become an alternative to cloud-based SSO and VPN solutions,
          as well as closed-source Microsoft and Cisco deployments.
