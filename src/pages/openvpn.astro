  {
    question: "How much faster is WireGuard compared to OpenVPN?",
    answer: "WireGuard is significantly faster than OpenVPN—typically 3x or more in real-world conditions. This is because WireGuard operates at the kernel level with only ~4,000 lines of code, while OpenVPN runs in userspace with over 100,000 lines. WireGuard's stateless design also enables instant connections (<100ms) versus OpenVPN's multi-second handshakes."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I migrate from OpenVPN Access Server to Defguard?",
    answer: "Yes. Defguard is designed as a complete replacement for OpenVPN Access Server. It provides all enterprise features including user management, SSO integration, MFA, and centralized administration—but with the performance benefits of WireGuard. Our documentation includes step-by-step migration guides."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Defguard support the same authentication methods as OpenVPN?",
    answer: "Defguard supports more authentication options than OpenVPN. In addition to TOTP and certificate-based auth, Defguard offers biometric MFA (using mobile device biometrics for desktop authentication) and native SSO integration with providers like Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace, Okta, and JumpCloud."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Defguard handle network changes compared to OpenVPN?",
    answer: "WireGuard handles network changes (like switching from Wi-Fi to cellular) seamlessly without dropping connections. OpenVPN typically loses the connection during network transitions and requires reconnection. This makes Defguard ideal for mobile workers and users who frequently change networks."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Defguard open-source like OpenVPN?",
    answer: "Defguard's core components are open-source under the Apache 2.0 license, including the server (Core), gateway, and clients. Some enterprise features require a license. All core code is fully auditable, and we publish <a href='/pentesting' target='_blank'>public penetration testing reports</a>."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I deploy Defguard alongside my existing OpenVPN setup?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Many organizations run Defguard in parallel with their existing OpenVPN infrastructure during migration. You can gradually move users to Defguard while keeping OpenVPN operational, ensuring zero downtime during the transition."
  },
  {
    question: "What enterprise features does Defguard offer that OpenVPN doesn't?",
    answer: "Defguard includes features not available in standard OpenVPN: true <a href='https://docs.defguard.net/features/wireguard/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-2fa' target='_blank'>protocol-level MFA</a> (not just login-time auth), <a href='https://docs.defguard.net/features/wireguard/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-2fa' target='_blank'>biometric authentication</a> via mobile, <a href='/blog/defguard-1.6-release-notes/'>zero-touch enrollment</a> at scale, <a href='https://docs.defguard.net/features/service-locations' target='_blank'>pre-logon VPN</a> for Active Directory, real-time configuration sync to all clients, built-in <a href='https://docs.defguard.net/features/access-control-list' target='_blank'>Access Control Lists</a> with firewall management, and comprehensive <a href='https://docs.defguard.net/features/activity-log' target='_blank'>audit logging</a> with SIEM integration."
