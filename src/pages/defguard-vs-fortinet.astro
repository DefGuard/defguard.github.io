  {
    question: "How does Defguard protect against vulnerabilities like COATHANGER?",
    answer: "Legacy appliances are vulnerable to persistent malware because they run large, monolithic codebases. Defguard is built on a modern microservices architecture and open-source Rust code, minimizing the attack surface. Unlike legacy protocols which are inherently complex, WireGuard is lean and auditable. <a href='/blog/ssl-vpn-performance-protocol-problem/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Read about the fundamental limitations of the SSL VPN protocol</a>."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Defguard client to connect to my existing FortiGate SSL VPN?",
    answer: "No. Defguard is not a \"Direct Fortinet Replacement\" client wrapper like OpenFortiVPN. We replace the entire legacy VPN stack. Defguard is a Protocol-Based Solution that requires installing a secure Gateway (Server) to handle traffic using the modern WireGuard® protocol instead of slow SSL VPN tunnels."
  },
  {
    question: "How is Defguard different from OpenVPN or raw WireGuard®?",
    answer: "Defguard belongs to the Protocol-Based Solutions category (like OpenVPN Access Server) but offers a modern architecture. While OpenVPN is legacy software and raw WireGuard lacks management features, Defguard provides a complete VPN Platform. It combines WireGuard performance with an Enterprise Management UI, MFA/2FA, and SSO — everything included in a self-hosted setup."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a separate license for endpoint and device management like FortiClient EMS?",
    answer: "No. Unlike Fortinet's fragmented model (Gateway + EMS), Defguard is a single, cohesive platform. Identity management, policy enforcement, and device provisioning are integrated directly into the system, not sold as an add-on. You get a unified control plane for both network access and fleet management — eliminating the need to deploy or license a separate EMS server."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I replace Fortinet's VPN solution without replacing my FortiGate firewall?",
    answer: "Yes. You can keep your existing FortiGate firewall for perimeter security and simply offload the VPN traffic to Defguard. Deploying Defguard alongside your current firewall (as a \"sidecar\") is the fastest way to upgrade your remote access performance without disrupting your core network infrastructure. <a href='/blog/fortigate-wireguard-migration/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Read our step-by-step guide on how to migrate from SSL VPN to WireGuard</a>."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Defguard provide Zero Trust (ZTNA) and SSO integration?",
    answer: "Defguard enables a self-hosted ZTNA architecture by enforcing \"Identity-First\" access. We natively integrate with any OIDC Provider, including Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Okta, and Google Workspace. Unlike legacy VPNs that trust IP addresses, Defguard verifies user identity and MFA status before allowing access. This delivers robust Zero Trust security out of the box — eliminating the need for expensive components like FortiAuthenticator."

        <h2>Architecture: Why the Fortinet Monolith is Slow</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Fortinet's VPN solution</strong> relies on a traditional model where the <strong>FortiClient</strong> endpoint connects to a central <strong>FortiGate</strong> appliance. All traffic is funneled through a central FortiGate appliance. 
          This monolithic architecture, where dozens of services are bundled into the FortiOS codebase, creates a single, massive point of 
          failure and a performance bottleneck. For a Head of IT, this means any attack on the gateway can bring the entire remote access 
          infrastructure down.
        </p>
        <p>
          In stark contrast, Defguard employs a <a href="https://docs.defguard.net/in-depth/architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern microservice architecture</a> that segregates the control and data planes. The control plane operates 
          exclusively within your internal network, inaccessible from the public internet. The data plane, built on WireGuard®, is decentralized, 
          enabling direct connections that eliminate bottlenecks, improve latency, and enhance reliability.

        <h2>Security: Vulnerabilities & The "Unpatchable" Risk (COATHANGER)</h2>
        <p class="critical-section">
          This is the most critical differentiator. Fortinet's security model has proven to be dangerously fragile against sophisticated threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>FortiGate</strong> appliance's design has resulted in a recurring pattern of critical, remotely exploitable vulnerabilities (like <strong><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-21762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2024-21762</a></strong>). These flaws have been actively exploited by state-sponsored actors like <strong><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China's Volt Typhoon</a></strong> to gain initial access to critical infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the greatest failure is the <strong>inability to recover from a breach</strong>. According to Dutch intelligence services (MIVD), a custom Remote Access Trojan named <strong><a href="https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc/documenten/publicaties/2024/februari/6/mivd-aivd-advisory-coathanger-tlp-clear/TLP-CLEAR+MIVD+AIVD+Advisory+COATHANGER.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COATHANGER</a></strong> was developed specifically for <strong>FortiGate</strong> devices. This malware:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Survives reboots and firmware upgrades.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Hides its presence by hooking system calls,</strong> making it invisible to standard admin tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Was used to compromise at least 20,000 FortiGate devices globally.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For a CISO, this is a catastrophic risk. It means that even after applying a patch, the <strong>FortiGate</strong> device cannot be trusted, creating unacceptable business risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defguard's foundation on its <a href="https://github.com/DefGuard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source Rust codebase</a> provides a modern, auditable cryptographic suite with a minimal attack surface. You can verify the code, not just trust a vendor's opaque security claims.

        <h2>Identity: Native MFA vs. The FortiAuthenticator Trap</h2>
        <p>
          Fortinet requires a complex ecosystem for modern authentication, needing separate products like FortiAuthenticator for SSO and 
          FortiToken for MFA. This fragments security and inflates costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defguard simplifies this natively. It includes a built-in Identity Provider (IdP) and supports any OIDC provider (Microsoft, Google, 
          Okta) out of the box, with no extra licenses, reducing the burden on IT teams.

        <p>
          Scaling remote access creates an "Empty Client" problem: distributing the app is easy, but securely distributing secrets is hard. Fortinet forces you to buy <strong>FortiClient EMS</strong> to solve this. Defguard solves it using the infrastructure you already own: Active Directory or Entra ID.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer true Zero-Touch Provisioning. Admins batch-generate tokens via API and sync them to user profiles. When you push the MSI via Intune or GPO, the client auto-detects the domain, retrieves the token, and pre-configures itself. Users launch the app and connect immediately: no emails, no copy-pasting, and no Helpdesk tickets.
