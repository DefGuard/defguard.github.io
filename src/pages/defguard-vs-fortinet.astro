        <h2>Defguard vs Fortinet architecture overview and performance implications</h2>
        <p>
          Fortinet's FortiClient VPN uses a traditional client-server or hub-and-spoke model. A typical setup requires FortiClient, 
          the endpoint agent, and FortiGate—FortiClient and FortiGate are not the same. FortiGate began as the "hub" hardware 
          offering that acts as a firewall, gateway, and policy enforcement point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remote users connect to a FortiGate gateway using FortiClient. All traffic goes through a FortiGate access proxy, 
          which also acts as an enforcer of access policies to internal applications. In other words, the control plane and 
          data plane both flow through FortiGate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fundamentally, Fortinet's design choice impacts speed and performance. The farther the client device is from the gateway, 
          the greater the impact. To counteract this, more FortiGate enforcement points can be set up, adding more management required.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to Fortinet, Defguard does not use a traditional model, instead employing a secure microservice architecture 
          with an internal Core and external stateless Proxy. The Core operates exclusively within your internal network, making it 
          inaccessible from the internet. Remote connections are handled by the secure, stateless Proxy component.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because WireGuard is built into the kernel or runs in a high-efficiency module, it is capable of high throughput with 
          low overhead. Furthermore, the distributed nature of this data plane means there is no single bottleneck like a gateway. 
          Traffic takes the shortest path available, improving reliability and latency.
        </p>

        <h2>Fortinet VPN vs Defguard encryption and security</h2>
        <p>
          Fortinet's FortiClient VPN uses TLS encryption (SSL/TLS tunneling) for securing data between the FortiClient endpoint 
          and the FortiGate. It leverages industry‑standard IPsec (IKEv1/IKEv2) with configurable ciphers (AES‑256, 3DES, 
          ChaCha20, HMAC‑SHA variants) for VPN tunnels, plus TLS for HTTPS management sessions and SSL inspection on NGFWs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortinet is ending support for SSL VPN tunnel mode and is now forcing a migration to IPsec VPN solutions. The functionality of SSL VPN has been deprecated and is no longer supported. This creates a significant migration cost for customers who are not using IPsec VPN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortinet's approach allows for deep inspection for malware or anomalies through NGFW (next-generation firewall) services. 
          However, setups with an inline device broaden the attack surface by adding another target that attackers might try to exploit. 
          Hardware appliances remain an internet-facing entry point and must be secured, while being a security chokepoint for both 
          the control plane and data plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          An alternative to Fortinet's approach, Defguard's data plane is peer-to-peer and decentralized, which keeps user data 
          private between the endpoints by design. When two devices communicate, they establish a direct WireGuard tunnel with each 
          other's public keys. In effect, every pair of communicating nodes has its own private, secured channel.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for encryption, Defguard exclusively uses the WireGuard protocol for its data plane, which has a fixed cryptographic 
          suite including ChaCha20 for encryption and Poly1305 for authentication. WireGuard's simplicity makes it easier to audit 
          for security vulnerabilities, reducing the attack surface and increasing overall reliability.

      <section id="authentication">
        <h2>Fortinet VPN vs Defguard authentication</h2>
        <p>
          Fortinet's FortiClient VPN allows authentication against local FortiGate accounts and enterprise directories like 
          LDAP/Active Directory. Integration with FortiAuthenticator is required to enable federated SSO via SAML/OAuth or 
          other identity providers. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) further requires FortiToken or third-party integrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          An alternative to Fortinet, Defguard simplifies authentication natively by relying on identity providers and SSO login. 
          No extra software or setup required, users can authenticate with their provider of choice, such as Google, Microsoft, 
          Okta, or other custom identity providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defguard users have flexible and secure authentication options. They can either authenticate with Defguard's own internal Identity Provider (IdP) or leverage a wide range of <a href="https://docs.defguard.net/enterprise/all-enteprise-features/external-openid-providers">external provider</a>, such as Google, Microsoft EntraID, Okta, and any other OpenID Connect-compliant provider. Once a user is successfully enrolled, they are empowered to securely add and manage new devices themselves, a key feature that is consistent with modern, user-centric security paradigms.

    <ProductSection padding="small">
      <section id="policy-enforcement">
        <h2>Fortinet VPN vs Defguard policy enforcement</h2>
        <p>
          Fortinet's policy enforcement occurs at the FortiGate, designed to be a security chokepoint. Administrators can define 
          access rules incorporating user identity, device posture, and application attributes. FortiGate will only allow a specific 
          session to any given application if all conditions are satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defguard uses an identity-based ACL system. Administrators define an ACL policy that specifies which users or groups 
          can access which destinations (IP addresses or tags) and on which ports. Administrators can specify policies per user 
          and device name instead of IP addresses. Using groups and tags, administrators can implement Role-Based Access controls 
          (RBACs) easily.

    <ProductSection padding="small">
      <section id="setup-management">
        <h2>Fortinet VPN vs Defguard initial setup and management</h2>
        <p>
          Fortinet's FortiClient VPN requires a complex setup. It requires installing FortiClient, deploying FortiGate with 
          FortiOS, and setting up FortiClient EMS for endpoint management. This means setting up not only software, but potentially 
          also hardware. All of this has an absolute dependence on an IT team and their resources, even for mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Administering FortiClient VPN and FortiOS on FortiGate means dealing with FortiOS policies, possibly FortiManager or 
          FortiClient EMS for large-scale deploys, and coordinating between network and security teams. These policies require 
          planning, though they are appropriately granular if done correctly. When it comes time to offboard, FortiClient VPN 
          requires disabling the user account on the FortiGate or in the directory and possibly uninstalling or locking their FortiClient.
        </p>
        <p>
          "An alternative to Fortinet, Defguard focuses on simplified installation and administration. There's no hardware to deploy, and getting started is a one-line process, allowing you to quickly set up a complete and secure environment. You can find the one-line install instructions in the <a href="https://docs.defguard.net/getting-started/one-line-install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defguard Getting Started documentation</a>.

        <h2>Fortinet VPN vs Defguard cost</h2>
        <p>
          Fortinet's licensing model can be complex, often requiring multiple licenses and fees to set up a secure VPN solution. This typically involves managing separate subscriptions for the FortiGate firewall, FortiClient VPN software, and additional FortiTokens for multi-factor authentication. Navigating these different tiers for features, support, and hardware, often with the help of sales representatives and resellers, can lead to unforeseen and additional costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, Defguard's approach is designed for simplicity and transparency. It offers a single, clear license that covers all enterprise features, including MFA and external IdP/SSO integrations. You can purchase either monthly or annual subscriptions directly from the website, with the license delivered instantly. Multi-year and offline licenses are also available as custom options. Pricing is straightforward, based on tiers that depend only on the number of users and locations, with no hidden fees or additional costs.
