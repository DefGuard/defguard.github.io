You may be wondering: _why is Defguard open source?_

As of January 2024, a pivotal change took place in Switzerland. The new **Swiss EMBAG law** officially supports the use of open source software across federal administration. This marks a huge step toward **more transparency, better collaboration, and stronger digital sovereignty**

One of the most exciting aspects? When the Swiss government builds software, it’s now required to publish the source code — unless there’s a clear legal reason not to.

This move is especially critical for **open source security solutions**, which play a vital role in safeguarding government infrastructure. With transparent code and community-driven development, these tools provide a much-needed level of **auditability and trust** — both essential for protecting public systems in an increasingly digital world.

We expect other countries to follow Switzerland’s lead, realizing that **openness, sovereignty, and security are not in conflict — they’re fundamentally connected**.

For us, this is a powerful signal. It reinforces our belief that our strategic decision to build **Defguard** as a fully **open source and self-hosted** solution is in line with where the world is headed. We’re not just following a trend — **we're building the new standard.**
