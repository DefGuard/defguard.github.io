## Overview

Keep this reference handy when designing WireGuard network topologies. For complex routing scenarios, test in a lab before production deployment.

## What AllowedIPs Actually Does

AllowedIPs serves **two functions simultaneously**:

1. **Routing (outbound):** Which destination IPs should be sent through this peer
2. **Filtering (inbound):** Which source IPs are accepted from this peer

Think of it as: "This peer is allowed to send/receive traffic for these IP ranges."

## Common Configurations

### Full Tunnel (All Traffic Through VPN)

```ini
[Peer]
PublicKey = <server_public_key>
Endpoint = vpn.example.com:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0    # All IPv4 and IPv6 traffic
```

**Use case:** All internet traffic through VPN (privacy, compliance, security)

**Warning:** This routes EVERYTHING through VPN, including DNS. Ensure VPN server can reach the internet.

---

### Split Tunnel (Only Corporate Resources)

```ini
[Peer]
PublicKey = <server_public_key>
Endpoint = vpn.example.com:51820
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16
```

**Use case:** Access internal resources while using local internet for everything else

**Advantage:** Reduces VPN server load, faster internet access

---

### Single Host Access

```ini
[Peer]
PublicKey = <server_public_key>
Endpoint = vpn.example.com:51820
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.50/32    # Only this one IP
```

**Use case:** Restrict access to a single server

---

### Multiple Non-Contiguous Ranges

```ini
[Peer]
PublicKey = <server_public_key>
Endpoint = vpn.example.com:51820
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/24, 10.5.0.0/24, 172.16.50.0/24
```

**Use case:** Access multiple separate subnets

---

## Server-Side vs Client-Side

### Server Config (Gateway)

```ini
# Server accepts traffic FROM THIS CLIENT only when source IP matches these ranges
[Peer]
PublicKey = <client_public_key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.10/32, 10.0.0.0/24    # Client's IP + networks it can access
```

### Client Config

```ini
# Client routes THESE DESTINATIONS through server
[Peer]
PublicKey = <server_public_key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/24     # All of internal network
```

**Key insight:** Server and client AllowedIPs serve different purposes:
- Server: "What IPs can this client claim as source?"
- Client: "What destinations should go through VPN?"

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Overlapping AllowedIPs

```ini
# BAD: Two peers with overlapping ranges
[Peer]
PublicKey = <peer_a>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/16    # 10.0.x.x

[Peer]  
PublicKey = <peer_b>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.1.0/24    # Also 10.0.x.x - OVERLAP!
```

**Result:** Traffic to 10.0.1.x could go to either peer (undefined behavior)

**Fix:** Use non-overlapping, most-specific routes

---

### Mistake 2: Incorrect Source IP Ranges

```ini
# BAD: Server config doesn't match client's actual tunnel IP
[Peer]
PublicKey = <client>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/24    # Client uses 10.1.0.5, but this allows 10.0.x.x sources only
```

**Result:** Client can't communicate because its source IP (10.1.0.5) doesn't match allowed ranges

**Fix:** Include client's actual tunnel IP in server's AllowedIPs: `AllowedIPs = 10.1.0.5/32, 10.0.0.0/24`

---

### Mistake 3: Full Tunnel Breaking Local Access

```ini
# Client config
[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0    # All traffic through VPN
```

**Problem:** Local network (printer, NAS) unreachable

**Fixes:**
1. **Exclude local subnet (recommended):**
   ```ini
   AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, !192.168.1.0/24    # All except local network
   ```
   *Note: Not all WireGuard implementations support exclusion syntax*

2. **Use CIDR math workaround:**
   ```ini
   AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/1, 128.0.0.0/1    # Covers all IPv4 except 0.0.0.0/0 exactly
   ```

3. **OS-specific routing:** Configure local routes to bypass VPN interface

---

### Mistake 4: DNS Leaks in Split Tunnel

```ini
# Client config - split tunnel
[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/8
DNS = 10.0.0.1    # Corporate DNS
```

**Problem:** DNS queries might still go to ISP DNS

**Fix:** Ensure DNS server IP is in AllowedIPs, or use full tunnel for DNS:
```ini
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.1/32
```

## Quick Subnet Reference

| CIDR | Addresses | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| /32 | 1 | Single host |
| /24 | 256 | Small subnet |
| /16 | 65,536 | Large network |
| /8 | 16.7M | Entire class A |
| /0 | All | Full tunnel |

## Defguard and AllowedIPs

When using Defguard:

1. **Location configuration** defines which networks that VPN location provides access to
2. **User/device assignment** determines which locations a user can connect to
3. **AllowedIPs is auto-generated** based on location settings

**Verify in [docs.defguard.net](https://docs.defguard.net):** How to configure location network ranges and per-user access

**Advantage:** No manual AllowedIPs management, reduces routing conflicts

---

## Debugging AllowedIPs Issues

### Check Current Routes

```bash
# Linux - show routing table
ip route show table all | grep wg0

# macOS
netstat -rn | grep utun
```

### Verify Peer Configuration

```bash
# Show all peers and their AllowedIPs
wg show wg0 allowed-ips
```

### Test Routing Decision

```bash
# Which interface would this IP use?
ip route get 10.0.0.50
```
