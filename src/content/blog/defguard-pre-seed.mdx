Just a few months after launching its Enterprise platform offering, Defguard has earned the trust of some of the world's most demanding organizations. The solution is already in use by major automotive corporations, NASCAR teams, manufacturing plants, data centers and cloud providers, game developers, venture capital funds, as well as numerous government institutions and public entities across the EU.
