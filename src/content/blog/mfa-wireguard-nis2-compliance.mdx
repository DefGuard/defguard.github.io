Organizations seeking compliance with the NIS2 Directive can leverage Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), not just as a regulatory checkbox but as a crucial layer of defense in their cybersecurity strategy. In this article, we’ll explore how MFA supports NIS2 compliance, the advantages of implementing MFA in modern Virtual Private Network (VPN) systems like **[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)**, and how open-source VPN management solutions like **[Defguard](https://defguard.net/)** facilitate MFA integration in WireGuard environments—while also providing functionalities like identity management, Single Sign-On (SSO), and hardware key management.

## Understanding the NIS2 Directive

The NIS2 Directive (Network and Information Security Directive) builds upon its predecessor (NIS Directive) with more stringent requirements aimed at bolstering the cybersecurity resilience of critical infrastructure sectors, including energy, transport, health, and financial services.

**It mandates that organizations implement stronger security measures to protect networks, systems, and data. A key component of NIS2 is the focus on MFA.**

MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to present two or more verification factors to access a system. According to the **[2025 Verizon DBIR](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Te12/reports/2025-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf)**, around 60% of all breaches involved the human element, including stolen credentials, making MFA a critical defense against common attack vectors.

## The Role of MFA in NIS2 Compliance

Multi-factor authentication is emphasized in the NIS2 Directive for several reasons. First, it helps mitigate the risks associated with compromised passwords. MFA strengthens the security of authentication processes by requiring more than just a password, thus making it more difficult for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems.

For organizations, MFA provides several security advantages:
* **Strengthening access control:** MFA makes it exponentially harder for attackers to breach systems, even if they manage to steal a user’s password.
* **Reducing the risk of phishing attacks:** Even if an attacker tricks a user into providing their login credentials, MFA adds another layer of verification that phishing alone cannot bypass.
* **Mitigating insider threats:** MFA reduces the likelihood that compromised insider credentials will lead to a security breach.

## Why Does NIS2 Require MFA for VPN Access?

Many organizations use VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to allow employees remote access to company resources. This becomes especially critical when employees work from various locations or connect to the corporate network via public or unsecured networks. Traditionally, VPNs provided a secure tunnel between the user and the network, but the increasing sophistication of attacks, including credential stuffing and brute force attacks, has highlighted the need for stronger authentication mechanisms like MFA.

As part of the NIS2 Directive, companies relying on VPN infrastructure to manage access to their network will be required to adopt MFA for VPN authentication. This ensures that even if VPN credentials are compromised, unauthorized access will still be difficult to achieve without additional factors, such as a biometric scan or a one-time passcode (OTP).

## WireGuard: The Modern VPN That Needs MFA Support

While older VPN protocols like OpenVPN and IPSec have served well for many years, modern solutions like WireGuard are becoming more popular due to their speed, simplicity, and security benefits. WireGuard is a newer VPN protocol that offers a streamlined, efficient, and highly secure method for establishing VPN connections.

Some of the benefits of WireGuard over traditional VPN protocols include:
* **Speed:** WireGuard is lightweight, leading to faster connection times and lower latency compared to older protocols.
* **Simplicity:** WireGuard uses fewer lines of code, making it easier to audit, manage, and configure, which translates to a lower chance of security vulnerabilities.
* **Security:** The cryptographic protocols in WireGuard are modern and robust, ensuring that even if vulnerabilities are discovered in older protocols, WireGuard remains resilient.

Given these advantages, many organizations are transitioning to WireGuard to handle their VPN needs. However, ensuring that WireGuard implementations comply with the NIS2 Directive’s MFA requirements is critical. Fortunately, solutions such as Defguard now make it possible to integrate MFA with WireGuard seamlessly.

## Beyond MFA: Defguard’s Broader Cybersecurity Capabilities

While **[Defguard](https://defguard.net/server/)** excels in integrating MFA with WireGuard VPNs, its functionality extends far beyond that. It provides organizations with a comprehensive security management toolkit, making it a powerful solution for various aspects of cybersecurity compliance and management. In addition to MFA, Defguard offers features like:

### Identity Management

Defguard helps organizations manage digital identities across their network infrastructure. With centralized identity management, businesses can control who has access to what systems and resources. This is crucial for compliance with not only NIS2 but other regulations like GDPR. Defguard’s identity management ensures that access permissions are consistent, up-to-date, and secure.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

SSO functionality is another powerful feature offered by Defguard. Single Sign-On simplifies the user experience by allowing employees to use one set of credentials to access multiple applications and services. This improves security by reducing the number of login credentials users need to remember and manage, while also minimizing the attack surface for cybercriminals who rely on stolen credentials. By integrating SSO with MFA, Defguard creates a secure, user-friendly authentication experience that reduces the risk of compromised credentials and makes compliance with NIS2 easier.

### Hardware Key Management

Another vital feature of Defguard is its ability to manage hardware keys like YubiKeys or other FIDO2 tokens. These hardware-based security keys provide an even stronger form of MFA by requiring a physical device to complete the authentication process. Hardware keys are especially useful for high-security environments where traditional software-based MFA methods might not provide sufficient protection. Managing hardware keys can be challenging, but Defguard simplifies the process, allowing organizations to securely deploy, manage, and revoke access to hardware-based authentication devices across their network.

## How Does Defguard Enable MFA for WireGuard?

Defguard is designed to enhance WireGuard by adding an MFA layer and offering additional capabilities like identity management, SSO, and hardware key management, helping organizations meet NIS2 compliance.

### How Does Defguard Support MFA for WireGuard?

Defguard integrates with standard MFA mechanisms such as OTPs (One-Time Passwords), commonly used through mobile apps like Google Authenticator or Authy. Once configured, users must provide a one-time code in addition to their WireGuard VPN credentials. Defguard also supports:
* **Biometric Authentication:** Such as fingerprint or facial recognition for even more robust security.
* **Push Notifications:** Where users can approve or deny login attempts through mobile push notifications, further enhancing security.

This makes managing and deploying MFA with WireGuard straightforward, enabling organizations to meet regulatory requirements while benefiting from WireGuard’s performance and security advantages.

## Managing MFA: Key Considerations for Easy Adoption

Implementing MFA requires careful planning and ongoing management to ensure that it doesn't become cumbersome for users or administrators. Here are a few tips to make the adoption of MFA easier:
* **User Experience:** Choose MFA methods that strike a balance between security and convenience. While biometric factors offer high security, they may not be feasible in all environments. OTPs or push notifications are commonly preferred for their ease of use.
* **Security Monitoring:** Once MFA is deployed, continuously monitor its effectiveness. This includes logging authentication attempts and keeping an eye on any suspicious activity.
* **Regular Audits:** MFA should be audited regularly to ensure that it continues to meet both security and regulatory requirements. This is especially important as new threats emerge or as the organization grows.

## The Difference Between MFA Systems

Not all MFA systems are created equal. Organizations can choose from a range of MFA solutions, each offering different security features and integration capabilities.

**Crucially, Defguard's approach is unique. While many MFA solutions operate only at the application level (e.g., protecting a web login), Defguard enforces MFA directly at the VPN connection level. This architectural difference means that no traffic can enter the network without passing the MFA check first, providing a fundamentally stronger security posture.
