Organizations seeking compliance with the NIS2 Directive must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as a crucial layer of defense for remote access.

In this article, we’ll explore the core challenge this presents for teams using VPNs with the **[WireGuard®](https://www.wireguard.com/)** protocol, and how **[Defguard](https://defguard.net/)** provides the definitive solution by enabling true, connection-level MFA.

## The Challenge: NIS2 Mandates MFA, but WireGuard® Lacks It

The NIS2 Directive (Network and Information Security Directive) builds upon its predecessor with more stringent requirements aimed at bolstering cybersecurity resilience. For remote access, the directive is clear:

**It mandates that organizations implement stronger security measures to protect networks, systems, and data. A key component of this is the focus on MFA for all access points, including VPNs.**

This presents a significant challenge. The WireGuard® protocol has become the foundation for modern, high-performance VPNs due to its speed and simplicity.

However, **the WireGuard® protocol itself does not include any native concept or mechanism for Multi-Factor Authentication.** This architectural reality means that a standard VPN built with WireGuard® is not inherently NIS2 compliant for MFA.

According to the **[2025 Verizon DBIR](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Te12/reports/2025-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf)**, around 60% of all breaches involved compromised credentials. Relying solely on a WireGuard® key pair—a single factor—leaves a critical security gap that fails to meet the layered defense principle required by NIS2.

## The Solution: How Defguard Enables True MFA for WireGuard®

Defguard is designed specifically to solve this problem by adding a robust, true MFA layer directly on top of the WireGuard® protocol.

It ensures that even if a user's private key is compromised, unauthorized access is blocked by requiring a second factor before the VPN connection is established.

Defguard integrates with modern MFA mechanisms directly at the VPN connection level. Supported methods for the VPN connection include:
* **Biometric Authentication**
* **One-Time Passwords (TOTP)**
* **External IdP/SSO**

This makes managing and deploying MFA for your VPN straightforward, enabling organizations to meet regulatory requirements while benefiting from WireGuard®’s performance advantages.

## The Difference: Why Defguard’s Connection-Level MFA is Superior

The term "VPN MFA" is often used broadly, but its implementation varies significantly. Many solutions apply MFA only at the application layer—for instance, protecting a web panel or the initial client setup.

While this offers some security, it leaves a critical gap: **it does not secure the VPN connection itself.**

**Defguard's approach is fundamentally different and unique: it is the only solution that enforces true Multi-Factor Authentication directly at the WireGuard® protocol level, before any connection is established.**

This architectural distinction means that no traffic can enter your network without first passing an MFA check, providing a superior security posture essential for NIS2 compliance. This ensures protection even if WireGuard® private keys are compromised.

## Why Build on the WireGuard® Protocol?

The WireGuard® protocol has quickly become the preferred foundation for modern VPNs, offering distinct advantages that make it an excellent choice for securing network access. Its design principles deliver superior performance and reliability.

* **Exceptional Speed:** WireGuard® operates efficiently at the kernel and protocol level, leading to significantly faster VPN throughput.
* **Resilient Connectivity:** Designed for stability, WireGuard® handles network transitions (e.g., switching from Wi-Fi to cellular) seamlessly, maintaining active connections without interruption.
* **Minimal Latency:** Its lightweight architecture and modern cryptographic stack result in remarkably low latency, enhancing user experience.
* **Rapid Connection Establishment:** WireGuard®'s efficient handshakes enable near-instantaneous VPN connections, minimizing wait times.

## Beyond MFA: Defguard’s Broader Cybersecurity Capabilities

While **[Defguard](https://defguard.net/server/)** excels at integrating MFA with VPNs using the WireGuard® protocol, its functionality extends far beyond that.

It provides a comprehensive security management toolkit for various aspects of compliance and administration. After solving the core MFA problem, you can leverage features like:

### Identity Management

Defguard helps organizations manage digital identities across their network infrastructure. This is crucial for compliance with not only NIS2 but other regulations like GDPR.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

SSO functionality is another powerful feature. It simplifies the user experience by allowing employees to use one set of credentials to access multiple applications, reducing password fatigue.

By integrating with **[external OpenID providers](https://docs.defguard.net/features/external-openid-providers)** or using the built-in IdP based on the **[OpenID Connect standard](https://docs.defguard.net/features/openid-connect)**, Defguard creates a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.

### Hardware Key Management

Another vital feature is the ability to manage hardware keys like YubiKeys.

**While Defguard offers robust YubiKey management for functions like SSH and GPG keys, it's important to note that hardware keys are not currently used as a second factor for the VPN connection flow itself.**

## Managing MFA: Key Considerations for Easy Adoption

Implementing MFA requires careful planning to ensure it doesn't become cumbersome.

* **User Experience:** Choose MFA methods that strike a balance between security and convenience. Biometric factors are often preferred for their ease of use.
* **Security Monitoring:** Once MFA is deployed, continuously monitor its effectiveness by logging authentication attempts and watching for suspicious activity.
* **Regular Audits:** MFA should be audited regularly to ensure it continues to meet both security and regulatory requirements.

## Conclusion

The NIS2 Directive elevates Multi-Factor Authentication from a best practice to a legal necessity for securing VPN access. The path to compliance for teams using the WireGuard® protocol is direct:

> **Organizations must implement stronger security measures to protect networks, systems, and data, with a key component being the focus on MFA.**

Solutions like Defguard make this straightforward by integrating true, connection-level MFA directly into your VPN. This provides a comprehensive, regulatory-compliant strategy to ensure your critical systems remain protected.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Is a VPN using the WireGuard® protocol alone sufficient for NIS2 compliance?
No. The base WireGuard® protocol does not include a native MFA mechanism, which is a key technical requirement for access control under the NIS2 Directive.

### What MFA methods does Defguard support for WireGuard® VPN connections?
Defguard supports true, connection-level MFA using Biometrics, Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP), and integration with external SSO providers like Google, Microsoft, Okta, and JumpCloud. For a **[full list of supported providers, see our documentation](https://docs.defguard.net/features/external-openid-providers)**.

### How is Defguard different from other MFA solutions?
Defguard is the only open-source platform that enforces MFA at the WireGuard® protocol level, not just at an application login. This provides a fundamentally higher level of security required for compliance.
