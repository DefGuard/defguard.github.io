Organizations seeking compliance with the NIS2 Directive can leverage Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), not just as a regulatory checkbox but as a crucial layer of defense in their cybersecurity strategy. In this article, we’ll explore how MFA supports NIS2 compliance, the advantages of implementing MFA in modern Virtual Private Network (VPN) systems like **[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)**, and how open-source VPN management solutions like **[Defguard](https://defguard.net/)** facilitate MFA integration in WireGuard environments—while also providing functionalities like identity management, Single Sign-On (SSO), and hardware key management.

## Understanding the NIS2 Directive

The NIS2 Directive (Network and Information Security Directive) builds upon its predecessor (NIS Directive) with more stringent requirements aimed at bolstering the cybersecurity resilience of critical infrastructure sectors, including energy, transport, health, and financial services.

**It mandates that organizations implement stronger security measures to protect networks, systems, and data. A key component of NIS2 is the focus on MFA.**

MFA provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to present two or more verification factors to access a system. According to the **[2025 Verizon DBIR](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Te12/reports/2025-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf)**, around 60% of all breaches involved the human element, including stolen credentials, making MFA a critical defense against common attack vectors.

## The Role of MFA in NIS2 Compliance

Multi-factor authentication is emphasized in the NIS2 Directive for several reasons. First, it helps mitigate the risks associated with compromised passwords. MFA strengthens the security of authentication processes by requiring more than just a password, thus making it more difficult for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems.

For organizations, MFA provides several security advantages:
* **Strengthening access control:** MFA makes it exponentially harder for attackers to breach systems, even if they manage to steal a user’s password.
* **Reducing the risk of phishing attacks:** Even if an attacker tricks a user into providing their login credentials, MFA adds another layer of verification that phishing alone cannot bypass.
* **Mitigating insider threats:** MFA reduces the likelihood that compromised insider credentials will lead to a security breach.

## Why Does NIS2 Require MFA for VPN Access?

Many organizations use VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to allow employees remote access to company resources. This becomes especially critical when employees work from various locations or connect to the corporate network via public or unsecured networks. Traditionally, VPNs provided a secure tunnel between the user and the network, but the increasing sophistication of attacks, including credential stuffing and brute force attacks, has highlighted the need for stronger authentication mechanisms like MFA.

As part of the NIS2 Directive, companies relying on VPN infrastructure to manage access to their network will be required to adopt MFA for VPN authentication. This ensures that even if VPN credentials are compromised, unauthorized access will still be difficult to achieve without additional factors, such as a biometric scan or a one-time passcode (OTP).

## WireGuard: The Modern VPN That Needs MFA Support

While older VPN protocols like OpenVPN and IPSec have served well for many years, modern solutions like WireGuard are becoming more popular due to their speed, simplicity, and security benefits. WireGuard is a newer VPN protocol that offers a streamlined, efficient, and highly secure method for establishing VPN connections.

Some of the benefits of WireGuard over traditional VPN protocols include:
* **Speed:** WireGuard is lightweight, leading to faster connection times and lower latency compared to older protocols.
* **Simplicity:** WireGuard uses fewer lines of code, making it easier to audit, manage, and configure, which translates to a lower chance of security vulnerabilities.
* **Security:** The cryptographic protocols in WireGuard are modern and robust, ensuring that even if vulnerabilities are discovered in older protocols, WireGuard remains resilient.

Given these advantages, many organizations are transitioning to WireGuard to handle their VPN needs. However, ensuring that WireGuard implementations comply with the NIS2 Directive’s MFA requirements is critical. Fortunately, solutions such as Defguard now make it possible to integrate MFA with WireGuard seamlessly.

## Beyond MFA: Defguard’s Broader Cybersecurity Capabilities

While **[Defguard](https://defguard.net/server/)** excels in integrating MFA with WireGuard VPNs, its functionality extends far beyond that. It provides organizations with a comprehensive security management toolkit, making it a powerful solution for various aspects of cybersecurity compliance and management. In addition to MFA, Defguard offers features like:

### Identity Management

Defguard helps organizations manage digital identities across their network infrastructure. With centralized identity management, businesses can control who has access to what systems and resources. This is crucial for compliance with not only NIS2 but other regulations like GDPR. Defguard’s identity management ensures that access permissions are consistent, up-to-date, and secure.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

SSO functionality is another powerful feature offered by Defguard. Single Sign-On simplifies the user experience by allowing employees to use one set of credentials to access multiple applications and services. This improves security by reducing the number of login credentials users need to remember and manage, while also minimizing the attack surface for cybercriminals who rely on stolen credentials. By integrating SSO with MFA, Defguard creates a secure, user-friendly authentication experience that reduces the risk of compromised credentials and makes compliance with NIS2 easier.

### Hardware Key Management

Another vital feature of Defguard is its ability to manage hardware keys like YubiKeys. **While Defguard offers robust YubiKey management and provisioning for functions like SSH and GPG keys, it's important to note that hardware keys are not currently used as a second factor for the VPN connection flow itself.** This distinction is crucial for understanding the full scope of security features.

## How Does Defguard Enable MFA for WireGuard?

Defguard is designed to enhance WireGuard by adding a true MFA layer and offering additional capabilities like identity management and SSO, helping organizations meet NIS2 compliance.

Defguard integrates with modern MFA mechanisms directly at the VPN connection level. Once configured, users must provide a second factor in addition to their WireGuard key to establish a connection. Supported methods for the VPN connection include:
* **Biometric Authentication**
* **One-Time Passwords (TOTP)**
* **External IdP/SSO**

This makes managing and deploying MFA with WireGuard straightforward, enabling organizations to meet regulatory requirements while benefiting from WireGuard’s performance and security advantages.

## Managing MFA: Key Considerations for Easy Adoption

Implementing MFA requires careful planning and ongoing management to ensure that it doesn't become cumbersome for users or administrators. Here are a few tips to make the adoption of MFA easier:
* **User Experience:** Choose MFA methods that strike a balance between security and convenience. Biometric factors offer high security and are often preferred for their ease of use.
* **Security Monitoring:** Once MFA is deployed, continuously monitor its effectiveness. This includes logging authentication attempts and keeping an eye on any suspicious activity.
* **Regular Audits:** MFA should be audited regularly to ensure that it continues to meet both security and regulatory requirements. This is especially important as new threats emerge or as the organization grows.

## The Difference: Understanding True Connection-Level VPN MFA

The term "VPN MFA" is often used broadly, but its implementation varies significantly across the market. Many solutions apply Multi-Factor Authentication only at the application layer, for instance, protecting the login to a web management panel or during the initial client setup. While this offers some security, it leaves a critical gap: **it does not secure the VPN connection itself.**

**Defguard's approach is fundamentally different and unique: it is the only solution that enforces true Multi-Factor Authentication directly at the WireGuard® protocol level, before any connection is established.** This architectural distinction means that no traffic can enter your network without first passing an MFA check, providing a superior security posture essential for NIS2 compliance. This ensures protection even if WireGuard private keys are compromised. Learn more about our approach to **[true, connection-level VPN MFA](https://defguard.net/vpn_mfa/)**.
