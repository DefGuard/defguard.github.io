A global investment firm focused on data sovereignty implemented a self-hosted, private cloud infrastructure to secure internal operations and protect sensitive financial data — with Defguard as a core fundament.

The solution enabled secure, role-based access (through enterprise VPN) across international teams, Defguard as a Single Sign-On (SSO) to authorize access to business applications (file sharing, chat, …), and centralized user onboarding and enrollment — all while maintaining full control over infrastructure.

By leveraging open-source technologies, the organization built a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional cloud-based systems, tailored to the needs of modern financial institutions.

## Uncompromising Security for Private Cloud Environment

As an investment firm operating in high-stakes sectors, Acquinox Capital manages extremely sensitive data across its operations — from internal communications and investor documentation to proprietary deal flow intelligence.

When **Kacper**, a senior Director of IT and Security, joined Acquinox, he knew that ensuring airtight security was non-negotiable. At the same time, the company founder had a strong strategic mandate to operate in a fully on-premise and largely open-source environment.

This applied across the board: document storage, communication infrastructure, internal systems, and access control. Balancing modern usability with enterprise-grade security in a self-hosted setup presented a unique set of technical and operational challenges.

> “Trying to solve the remote access problem, I've looked into popular solutions like Tailscale, Netbird or Firezone offering VPN management with Wireguard, but their focus lies in the cloud/SaaS and does not fit our scenario perfectly. Then I discovered Defguard, which is designed with private cloud use cases in mind and offers built-in identity and SSO. With Defguard documentation and support, the evaluation was fast and easy.”  
> — *Kacper Wiśniewski*

Acquinox quickly evaluated the solution — with help from the Defguard team — and confirmed that it fit perfectly into their private cloud strategy.

## Defguard Provides the Fundamental Security Layer

To meet internal security and operational requirements, the investment firm deployed a fully self-hosted (private cloud) infrastructure using a trusted stack of open-source tools for file sharing, chat, and more.

Acquinox leveraged **Defguard's full-stack identity, SSO, and VPN** — one login to all services. This approach minimized maintenance burden and deployment costs, solving integration issues and reducing external dependencies.

The risk of vendor lock-in was also mitigated: Defguard supports third-party identity and SSO providers, giving Acquinox the flexibility to switch solutions when necessary.

## Defguard is Purpose-Built for Private Cloud

Other decision factors in choosing Defguard included its **built-in multi-factor authentication (MFA)** at the **WireGuard protocol level**. Because this is handled entirely by the on-prem Defguard instance, **no data ever leaves Acquinox infrastructure** — unlike with cloud-first VPN solutions.

MFA is increasingly becoming mandatory under regulatory frameworks like **NIS2** and **DORA**, especially for financial institutions.

> “With Defguard in place it's super easy to manage user access on multiple levels — marketing and analysts have access to documentation systems, CRM, and analytics, while our engineers can manage infrastructure and services that we develop — e.g. our custom AI valuation tool.”

The design and architecture proposed by Defguard enabled the firm to use it as the **backbone of its entire private cloud infrastructure**.
