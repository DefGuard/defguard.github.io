title: Does Defguard support Google login?
order: 5
---

Defguard supports <a href="https://docs.defguard.net/enterprise/external-openid-providers#google" target="_blank">Google Workspace</a>: login and automatic account creation upon login, full user and group synchronization, and automatic user disabling or deletion based on Google's user status.

This functionality requires an <a href="/pricing/">Enterprise License</a> and is a paid feature.

Please remember that Defguard has also <a href="https://docs.defguard.net/admin-and-features/openid-connect" target="_blank">built in SSO based on OpenID Connect</a>, so you can migrate your apps to authorize with Defguard instead of 3rd party service (and this is an Open Source feature)!
