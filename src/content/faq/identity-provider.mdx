title: Does Defguard act as an Identity Provider (IdP)? What are its capabilities in this regard?
order: 10
---

Yes, Defguard is an **Identity Provider (IdP) compliant with the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol**. This allows external applications to be configured to use Defguard as SSO, offering a "Log in with Defguard" option. It provides an easy GUI for application configuration and a list of authenticated applications in each user's profile, with the ability to easily revoke consent for access.

As an IdP, Defguard supports multi-factor authentication using **TOTP, EMAIL one-time passwords, and hardware keys (e.g., YubiKey)** when logging into applications using Defguard-based SSO.

Thanks to its built-in IdP, Defguard provides a single solution for **one login/password and MFA system for logging into business applications and remote access simultaneously**.
