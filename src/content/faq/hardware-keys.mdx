Defguard offers a **hardware key configuration and initialization module (Workstation Provisioning)**, which enables simple and secure configuration of **YubiKey hardware keys** for users. These keys are used for authentication (SSH, GPG/FIDO2) as part of multi-factor authentication (MFA). After initialization, the user's profile displays key details such as the YubiKey serial number and associated public keys (SSH and GPG).
