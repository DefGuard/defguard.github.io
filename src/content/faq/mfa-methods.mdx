For the first authentication step, Defguard supports:

* **Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP)**, e.g., Google Authenticator or other desktop/mobile applications.
* **Time-based One-Time Password via EMAIL.**
* On mobile devices: **Biometrics (Touch ID, Face ID).**
* In case of integration with an **external identity provider (SSO)**, authentication occurs with that provider (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Okta, JumpCloud, OIDC) through a dedicated authentication session in the browser.
* **Hardware keys** (e.g., YubiKey) are supported when Defguard acts as an embedded identity provider for applications using SSO.
