title: Does defguard support Microsoft login?
order: 6
---

Defguard supports <a href="https://docs.defguard.net/enterprise/external-openid-providers#microsoft" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> login and automatic account creation upon login.

This functionality requires an <a href="/pricing/">Enterprise License</a> and is a paid feature.

Please remember that defguard has also <a href="https://docs.defguard.net/admin-and-features/openid-connect" target="_blank">built in SSO based on OpenID Connect</a>, so you can migrate your apps to authorize with defguard instead of 3rd party service (and this is an Open Source feature)!
