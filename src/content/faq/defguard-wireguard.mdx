order: 1

WireGuard® is a VPN protocol with some low-level command-line tools.
Defguard makes WireGuard® easy to deploy and use, adding additional features like

Defguard has its own VPN <a href="/client" target="_blank">desktop clients</a> (with mobile clients soon to be released) that include additional functionalities not available in standard WireGuard clients.

Defguard also offers features outside of VPN, such as built-in OpenID Connect SSO, Yubico YubiKey provisioning, and more!
