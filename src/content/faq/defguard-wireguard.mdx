title: What VPN protocol does Defguard use and why is it preferred?
order: 1
---

Defguard uses the **WireGuard** protocol for VPN infrastructure access. It is **technologically and security-wise more modern and secure than SSL VPN and IPsec**. Examples of innovations not supported by IPsec/SSL VPN include:

* **Stateless:** No session renegotiation, full resilience to packet loss, which means faster connections, resilience to network disruptions and IP changes, and ideal for mobile users, VPN always-on, and roaming.
* **High performance:** WireGuard operates in the system kernel (Linux kernel module), providing 2â€“5 times faster data transfer than OpenVPN and is significantly more CPU efficient than IPsec.

**What cryptographic algorithms does WireGuard use in Defguard?**

WireGuard in Defguard uses modern and most secure algorithms, not supporting outdated or insecure algorithms like 3DES, Blowfish, or RSA. These are:

* **ChaCha20** (encryption)
* **Poly1305** (authentication)
* **Curve25519** (key exchange)
