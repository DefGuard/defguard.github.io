title: What auditing features does Defguard offer and how can event logs be integrated with external systems?
order: 12
---

Defguard supports a **full event log** for both administrators (informing about every business event of each user, with detailed indication of VPN location, module, IP addresses) and for each user (detailed tracking of their own system activities).

The event log supports **streaming events to external SIEM systems**, such as:

* **Vector:** A lightweight observability pipeline program, enabling data forwarding to monitoring systems (Datadog, New Relic, Grafana Loki, Prometheus, InfluxDB, ClickHouse), SIEM and logging systems (ElasticSearch, Splunk HEC, Graylog, Mezmo, Axiom), and cloud services (AWS CloudWatch, Kinesis, S3, SNS/SQS; Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Monitoring, Storage).
* **Logstash:** Open-source server-side software that ingests, processes, and forwards data for logging and analysis purposes.
