title: How does Defguard handle user directory synchronization?
order: 11
---

Defguard supports **two-way synchronization of user and group directories** using an **LDAP server and Microsoft Active Directory**. It also allows choosing whether Defguard or LDAP/Active Directory is the primary source of user data during synchronization.

When Defguard is configured with an external identity provider, it supports synchronization of user and group directories with: **Google Workspace, Microsoft EntraID, and Okta**.
