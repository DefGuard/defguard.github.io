title: What are the basic security principles of Defguard's architecture.
order: 14
---

Defguard has a **secure architecture** that:

* Allows the main control plane component (Core) to run **in an internal network inaccessible from the Internet**, protecting all system and user data.
* All events requiring access from a public network (e.g., the Internet) are handled by a **stateless and secure Proxy component**.
* The Core component connects to the Proxy and **performs all business operations in a secure segment inaccessible from the public network, passing only the result of these operations to the proxy component**.
