title: What programming language is Defguard written in, and what security benefits does it offer?
order: 15
---

Defguard is written in **Rust**, which offers the following security benefits:

* **Prevents errors:** Rust prevents errors such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and use-after-free issues thanks to its ownership system, without the need for a garbage collector.
* **Compile-time checks:** It enforces strict compile-time checks regarding lifetimes, mutability, and borrowing, detecting many errors before the code even runs.
* **Safe concurrent programming:** Rust's type system prevents data races at compile time.
* **Secure dependency ecosystem:** Cargo and crates.io support reproducible builds, cryptographic signatures, and dependency auditing.
