Yes, defguard <a href="https://docs.defguard.net/enterprise/all-enteprise-features/access-control-list?utm_source=chatgpt.com">supports Access Control Lists (ACLs)</a> starting from version 1.3. This feature enables administrators to define and manage precise access rules for network resources, specifying which users, groups, or devices can access particular destinations based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. ACLs can be applied per location, allowing for granular control over network access. Additionally, administrators can set default policies (allow or deny) for unspecified traffic, ensuring a secure and tailored network environment.
