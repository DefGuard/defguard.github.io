order: 9
---

Desktop and Mobile clients offer many features:

* **Automatic configuration synchronization**.
* Support for **multiple VPN locations** and the ability to connect to **multiple Defguard instances**.
* The option to choose whether the VPN should route **only administrator-defined traffic (predefined traffic) or all device traffic (all traffic)**, with the ability to disable this feature in the admin panel.
* The desktop client offers **Grid** views (displaying all VPN locations and their status/statistics) and **Detailed** views (details of the selected location/connection, statistics, activity history).
* An **Enrollment process** for the desktop client, which, during the first configuration, not only automatically configures VPN locations but also allows the user to **securely remotely set the Defguard account password**, verify account data, and display the administrator's contact information.
* Defguard allows each user to **configure their own Desktop & Mobile devices** in their profile, without needing to contact an administrator, with the ability to enable this functionality.
* Support for managing network devices, where an administrator can configure device access to a selected VPN location using a server-side command-line client running as a system service (automatic synchronization) or manual WireGuard configuration (for older devices).
