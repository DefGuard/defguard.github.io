title: How does multi-factor authentication in Defguard protect against post-quantum attacks?
order: 5

Protection against post-quantum attacks is achieved through the **second authentication step using WireGuard PSK (Pre-Shared Key) keys**. This is a secret generated for each VPN session, optionally used alongside public/private keys, which enhances encryption.

[Learn about PSK-based MFA in the docs](https://docs.defguard.net/features/wireguard/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-2fa/architecture)
