title: Two-Factor Authentication with WireGuard PSK
order: 3
---
Since WireGuard protocol doesn't support 2FA, most (if not all) available WireGuard clients use 2FA authorization to the "application" itself (not Wireguard tunnel). When using this client with the <a href="https://github.com/defguard/defguard" target="_blank">defguard VPN & SSO server</a> (which is <strong>free & open source</strong>) you will get <strong>real 2FA using TOTP/Email codes + Wireguard Pre-shared session keys</strong>.
