title: Multi-Factor Authentication with WireGuard速 PSK
order: 2
---

Since WireGuard速 protocol doesn't support 2FA, most (if not all) available WireGuard速 clients use 2FA authorization to the "application" itself (not Wireguard tunnel).
When using this client with the <a href="https://github.com/defguard/defguard" target="_blank">defguard VPN & SSO server</a> (which is <strong>free & open source</strong>)
you will get <strong>real Multi-Factor Authentication using TOTP/Email codes + WireGuard速 Pre-shared session keys</strong>.
