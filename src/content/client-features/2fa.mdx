title: 2FA with WireGuard PSK
order: 1

Since Wireguard protocol doesn't support 2FA/MFA - most (if not all) currently available Wireguard clients do not support real Multi-Factor Authentication/2FA - and use 2FA just as authorization to the "application" itself (and not Wireguard tunnel). Integrating your client with the defguard VPN & SSO server (which is also free & open source) you will get real 2FA using Wireguard PSK keys and peers configuration using MFA easy!
