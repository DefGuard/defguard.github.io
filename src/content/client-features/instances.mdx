When combining with [defguard](https://github.com/DefGuard/defguard) VPN & SSO you can have multiple defguard instances (sites/installations) and multiple Locations (VPN tunnels in that location/site) in <strong>one client</strong>! If you are an admin/devops - all your customers (instances) and all their tunnels (locations) can be in one place!
