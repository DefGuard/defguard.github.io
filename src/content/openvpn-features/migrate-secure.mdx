title: Migrate to most secure VPN solution
order: 2
---

- WireGuard is part of Linux kernel (and not an application). WireGuard’s codebase (about 4,000 lines vs hundreds of thousands of lines of OpenVPN).
- WireGuard uses state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms, including ChaCha20 for encryption, Poly1305 for authentication, and Curve25519 for key exchange. This modern approach enhances security and efficiency.
- Minimal Attack Surface: The simplicity of WireGuard’s code reduces the potential for vulnerabilities, unlike OpenVPN, which has more complex code and therefore a larger attack surface.
