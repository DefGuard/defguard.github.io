title: Migrate to most fastest VPN solution
order: 1
---

- Faster VPN Speeds: WireGuard is ~10x faster then OpenVPN - since itâ€™s on kernel and protocol level and not application level (like OpenVPN)
- Seamless Roaming: WireGuard is designed to handle network changes (like switching from Wi-Fi to cellular) more gracefully than OpenVPN, maintaining the connection without interruption - wherase OpenVPN looses connections on network change.
- Lower VPN Latency: WireGuard has far lower latency than OpenVPN due to its lightweight design.
- Instant Connectivity: WireGuard's handshakes are very fast, allowing near-instantaneous connections, unlike OpenVPN, which can take a few seconds to establish a connection.
