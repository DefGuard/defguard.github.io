title: Secure Remote Enrollment & Onboarding
order: 2
---

The only solution that provides a [secure and remote user enrollment](https://docs.defguard.net/help/remote-user-enrollment) - a process, during which the user can:
double-check their data that admin provided during account setup, setup their password, **automatically configure the desktop client with all VPNs/locations**, and if in trouble get admin contact details.

<br />
After enrollment the user can be
[onboarded](https://docs.defguard.net/help/remote-user-enrollment/user-onboarding-after-enrollment)
with relevant company information, links to company systems, security guidelines, etc. In
the enrollment module, you can write custom messages using markdown that will be shown on
the last step of the enrollment process and sent to the user via email.
<br />
Enrollment is supported as a website, or **can be done with [defguard client](/client)**
which makes it a lot simpler and more secure.
