[Secure user remote enrollment](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/help/remote-user-enrollment) is a process, during which the user can: double-check their data, setup their password, configure a device to access VPN and secured systems, and if in trouble get admin contact detauls.

<br />
After enrollment the user can be
[onboarded](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/help/remote-user-enrollment/user-onboarding-after-enrollment)
with relevant company information, links to company systems, security guidelines, etc. In
the enrollment module, you can write custom messages using markdown that will be shown on
the last step of the enrollment process and sent to the user via email.
<br />
Enrollment is supported as a website, or **can be done with [defguard client](/client) **
which makes it a lot simpler and more secure. Also, during this process the client
configures all VPN locations automatically - all is done with just entering a secure
token, that can be emailed to the user automatically!
