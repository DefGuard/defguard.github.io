We've implemented Defguard in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for **code portability, security, and speed**.
You can easily run Defguard on various Linux-based systems on x86, arm, and other architectures
(including Raspberry PI, OpenWRT, etc.) and Unix systems FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and others.
We've prepared various [Linux and OPNsenseÂ®](https://docs.defguard.net/features/setting-up-your-instance) (FreeBSD) but we are constantly working on other platforms.
