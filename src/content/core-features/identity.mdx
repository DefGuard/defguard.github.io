The power of every organization is its users - secure your users data with your own SSO and stop relying on cloud/3rd party providers.
As a core principle, defguard is based and built on open standards:  
* [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) based Identity Provider
* [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/) synchronization - currently supporting users and groups synchronization
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as core data backend

Defguard SSO supports Multi-Factor Authentication to secure your apps and VPNs:

* **Time-based One-Time Password** Algorithm (TOTP - e.g. Google Authenticator)
* **Email** tokens
* **WebAuthn / FIDO2** - for hardware key authentication support and **Passkeys**
* **Web3** - authentication with crypto software and hardware wallets using Metamask, Wallet Connect, Ledger Extension
