As a core principle, Defguard is based and built on open standards with [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) based Identity Provider with Multi-Factor Authentication to secure your apps and VPNs:

- **Time-based One-Time Password** Algorithm (TOTP - e.g. Google Authenticator)
- **Email** tokens
- **WebAuthn / FIDO2** - for hardware key authentication support and **Passkeys**

Already using **Google/Microsoft or other OpenID Provider?**, Defguard supports [external OpenID provider login & registration](https://docs.defguard.net/enterprise/external-openid-providers).
