The power of every organization is its users.  
As a core principle, defguard is based and built on open standards:  
* [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) based Identity Provider
* [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/) synchronization - currently supporting users and groups synchronization
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as core data backend
