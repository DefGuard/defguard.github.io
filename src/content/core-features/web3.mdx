Since defguard secures the whole user journey (connections), 
from secure communication using VPN, to authentication based on company identity and 
**Multi-Factor Authentication (supporting crypto wallets)**, it's a perfect web2 -> web3 gateway for your organization.
Wallet management with **MetaMask** is an easy way for users to validate the ownership of wallets as there is no need to send wallet addresses through Slack/email anymore.
