title: Enterprise WireGuard® VPN with MFA/2FA
order: 2
---

Defguard has a unique and secure architecture as well as **first of it's kind Multi-Factor Authentication for WireGuard® with TOTP/Email and WireGuard® session Pre-Shared Keys**. Since WireGuard® protocol doesn't support 2FA, most (if not all) available WireGuard® solutions use 2FA authorization to the "application" itself (not Wireguard® tunnel). By using our desktop application defguard provides **real MFA/2FA** - read more about it in our [documentation](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/admin-and-features/wireguard/architecture).
Other features:

- Beautiful <a href="/client" target="_blank">desktop clients</a> for Mac, Windows & Linux
- **multiple VPN Locations** (networks/sites) - with defined access (all users or only Admin group)
- multiple Gateways for each VPN Location (**high availability/failover**) - supported on a cluster of routers/firewalls for Linux, FreeBSD/pfSense®/OPNsense®
- **import** your current WireGuard® server configuration with a **wizard**!
- **dashboard and statistics overview** of connected users/devices for admins
- automatic IP allocation
- kernel (Linux, FreeBSD/OPNsense®/pfSense®) & userspace WireGuard® support with our Rust library
