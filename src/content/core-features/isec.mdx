defguard was **thoroughly and comprehensively audited** by one of the best **security researchers in Poland**: [ISEC](https://isec.pl/).

ISEC is also a strategic partner of defguard, reviewing every major release from a security perspective, making defguard one of the most secure core components in the open source ecosystem.

All Critical and Major issues have been fixed in dedicated [pull requests](https://github.com/DefGuard/defguard/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed). Retest will follow soon (we'll notify on our Twitter).
